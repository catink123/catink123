### Hello everyone! 👋
My name is Matvey, but I also go by different nicknames.

I'm a self-taught web developer and have many projects and ideas, some of which I brought to life, but others.. not so much! 😅

Here are some things about my life on GitHub:
- 📷 I created a website for my photography hobby: [Non&Meron](https://nonmeron.web.app/)
- 🏫 I made a simple game for a school project! [Physics-2048](https://github.com/catink123/physics-2048/) *(If you want to play it, click [here](https://catink123.github.io/physics-2048)!)* Also, I created a more serious game project as a task for university. [zuma-clone](https://github.com/catink123/zuma-clone)
- 👍 I developed a lot of little utilities and web apps for my friends and family! [CMHelper](https://catink123.github.io/CMHelper), [Manga Saver](https://catink123.github.io/mngsav/), ["Smeta"](https://catink123.github.io/smeta) and [Genshin Impact Gachi Helper](https://catink123.github.io/gigachihelper/) to name a few. 

Some facts about myself:
- 🐣 I liked to dig around in computers (software and hardware) since I was a little baby!
- 🌳 I love nature. I like the idea of being in open-air and walking through bushes and forests. 
- 🖼️ Photography is my hobby (as you already know). I love taking photos as much as writing code! 
- 🎶 I listen to music **a lot**. I can't live without listening to some tunes! I like relaxing music, but sometimes listen to heavy stuff. 🎸
